This is an end-to-end guide about how to migrate tables from JDBC sources (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) to IOMETE and display it in the BI dashboard.
___
### Intro

This is an end-to-end guide about how to migrate **tables** from JDBC sources (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) to iomete and display it in the BI dashboard. 

:::info
First, you need to establish an SSH tunnel between iomete and your database in your private network. See [Database Connection Options](https://iomete.com/docs/administration-guide/database-connection-options)
:::

### Database to migrate

Let's assume that we want to replicate the MySQL database (or any other supported JDBC database) to the **IOMETE** warehouse

:::info
In this tutorial, we will be using a publicly accessible iomete-tutorial database instance that contains the [Employees Sample Database. ](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/employee/en/sakila-structure.html)
:::

:::info
In case of connecting to your own database instance see [Database Connection Options](https://iomete.com/docs/administration-guide/database-connection-options) for the details
:::
Here are the details of `iomete-tutorial` public database:

```
Host: iomete-tutorial.cetmtjnompsh.eu-central-1.rds.amazonaws.com
Port: 3306
Username: tutorial_user
Password: 9tVDVEKp
```

The database contains the following tables:

| Table name   | Row count |
| :----------- | :-------- |
| employees    | 300024    |
| departments  | 9         |
| dept_manager | 24        |
| dept_emp     | 331603    |
| titles       | 443308    |
| salaries     | 2844047   |

### Create warehouse

Create a new warehouse instance

### Querying  Source Table

After having the lakehouse created, we create a table using JDBC Sources using [CREATE TABLE](https://iomete.com/docs/spark-sql/create-table) command. In the OPTIONS part we specify credentials of the database to which we want to connect as follows 
<!--TODO (see [JDBC Sources](./data-sources/jdbc-sources)):  -->
<!-- https://iomete.com/docs/guides/how-to-connect-iomete-and-apache-superset#get-connection-details-from-iomete -->

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employees_proxy
USING org.apache.spark.sql.jdbc
OPTIONS (
  url "jdbc:mysql://iomete-tutorial.cetmtjnompsh.eu-central-1.rds.amazonaws.com:3306/employees",
  dbtable "employees.employees",
  driver 'com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver',
  user 'tutorial_user',
  password '9tVDVEKp'
);

SELECT * FROM employees_proxy limit 100;
```

:::info
This table doesn't hold the actual data. Data will be retrieved from the actual source once we query the table

### Migrating Data

To move the data from the source to the warehouse, you can use one of the following options:

**  Non-partitioned Table    **

- **Option 1. Create a table from select**

```sql
-- Create table directly from the query
CREATE TABLE employees 
  AS SELECT  * FROM employees_proxy;
-- To inspect the table use the following query
DESC TABLE EXTENDED employees;
```

- **Option 2. Insert into to existing table**

```sql
--just append data
INSERT INTO employees
  SELECT  * FROM employees_proxy
--or you can use the follwing command to overwerite data
--first clean an existing data and then insert new data
INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE employees
  SELECT  * FROM employees_proxy
```

- **Option 3. Merge with existing data**

```sql
MERGE INTO employees
  USING (SELECT  * FROM employees_proxy) updates
  ON employees.emp_no = updates.emp_no
WHEN MATCHED THEN
  UPDATE SET *
WHEN NOT MATCHED
  THEN INSERT *
```

Partitioning data to speed up queries or DML that have predicates involving the partition columns. Here let's create an artificial column `birth_year` from `birth_date` and partition data by `birth_year`

```sql
SELECT SUBSTRING(birth_date, 0, 4) as birth_year, * FROM employees_proxy LIMIT 100;
```

### **Partitioned Table**

- **Option 1. Create a partitioned table from select**

```sql
-- Create a partitioned table directly from the query
CREATE TABLE employees_partitioned 
  PARTITIONED BY (birth_year)
AS SELECT SUBSTRING(birth_date, 0, 4) as birth_year, * FROM 
      employees_proxy order by birth_year; 

-- To inspect the table use the following query
DESC TABLE EXTENDED employees_partitioned;
```

- **Option 2. Insert into to existing table**

```sql
--just append data
INSERT INTO employees_partitioned
   SELECT SUBSTRING(birth_date, 0, 4) as birth_year, * FROM employees_proxy order by birth_year;

--or you can use the follwing command to overwerite data

--first clean an existing data and then insert new data
INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE employees_partitioned
   SELECT SUBSTRING(birth_date, 0, 4) as birth_year, * FROM employees_proxy order by birth_year;
```

- **Option 3. Merge with existing data**

```sql
MERGE INTO employees_partitioned
 USING (SELECT 
   SUBSTRING(birth_date, 0, 4) as birth_year, * FROM employees_proxy) updates
 ON employees_partitioned.emp_no = updates.emp_no
WHEN MATCHED THEN
  UPDATE SET *
WHEN NOT MATCHED
  THEN INSERT *
```
