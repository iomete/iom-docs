# IOMETE deployment on GCP

**Installing the IOMETE platform is a quick and easy process that won't take up much of your time**

Getting started with IOMETE is simple and can be done with just a few clicks. However, if you're new to using GCP, you'll need to install some tools on your local computer before you can begin. To get started, make sure you have a GCP account.

:::info
To install new resources you have to provide a **project id**. It's possible to use the existing project but, we recommend to create a new project to isolate access and resources. See: https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project
:::


## Required tools

Make sure you have the following tools installed on your local computer:

- **Google CLI:**: Visit the [Google CLI installation guide](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install-sdk).
- **Terraform:**: Visit the [Terraform installation guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)
    

## Signup for IOMETE

### Create an organization

Register for an account on the [IOMETE Console](https://app.iomete.cloud/dashboard) and create an organization.

### Create a New Cluster

Select the provider (we currently support only AWS) and select the region where the cluster will be installed.

### Define the workspace name

Workspaces are isolated spaces that can be used by different departments, divisions, and so.

### Terraform configuration
  
The system will generate a terraform script including unique `cluster_id`.

:::danger
Donâ€™t change cluster_id, this ID will be used to access your cluster (ex. connect external BI tools).
:::

## Deploy IOMETE to GCP

Download the terraform script file provided in the IOMETE console and execute it.

:::info
The use who will run the terraform script needs to have the following permissions:
- GCP Project Admin
:::

### 1. Navigate to the folder in CLI.

Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the terraform script file in your terminal.

### 2. Authenticate to GCP

```bash
gcloud auth login
```

:::info
Make sure you have selected the correct project.
:::

### 3. Apply the terraform script

```bash
# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Create a plan
terraform plan

# Apply the changes to your GCP
terraform apply
```

Once the **`terraform apply`** the command has finished, you should see a new file called **`IOMETE_DATA`** in the same folder where you ran the terraform script. This file contains the information you need to register your cluster with IOMETE.
Open the IOMETE control plane interface. Find the appropriate section or field to register your cluster. Paste the copied information from the IOMETE_DATA file into the respective fields in the IOMETE control plane. Follow any additional instructions or steps in the IOMETE control plane to complete the registration process.

:::info
Here are the fields you need to copy from the IOMETE_DATA file:
- GKE Name
- GKE Endpoint
- Cluster CA Certificate
- Cluster Service Account Key
  :::

Once you hit the `Execute` button, IOMETE will start the installing IOMETE operator inside the Kubernetes cluster. This will take a few minutes.

That's it! You've successfully set up IOMETE using Terraform. If you encounter any issues or have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact our support team at: [support@iomete.com](mailto:support@iomete.com).

:::note
It's important to store your Terraform state file in a secure location to avoid losing it. If you lose the state file, you won't be able to manage the cluster with Terraform anymore. You can store the state file in a git repository, S3 bucket, or local folder. For more information on Terraform backends, please refer the FAQ below about saving terraform state in an external location.
