## **v1.3.0**: Reduce cloud costs by ~50% üí∞

We're excited to announce some major improvements to IOMETE that will help you save costs and optimize your infrastructure.

:::caution

You might experience a brief downtime of 1-2 minutes during the upgrade.

**üì¢ What's New**

- We've grouped all nodes in the same availability zone to prevent data transfer charges. Additionally, we've decreased the desired node count from 2 to 1, resulting in up to 50% cost savings.
- We've added NAT Public IP to Workspace settings to simplify network configuration and management.
- We've increased node disk size to 100GB to prevent disk pressure issues that were present in earlier versions.

**üêû Bugs Fixed**

- Cluster role ARN is not displayed correctly in workspace settings (now renamed to cluster_role_arn).
- Fixed the IOMETE Terraform module version to ensure compatibility with other modules and dependencies.

## **v1.0.1**: Disabled detailed monitoring by default üîß

**üì¢ What's New**

- Disabled detailed monitoring of EC2 nodes. If you need to enable detailed monitoring add `enable_monitoring = true` under the module.
  - **Basic monitoring**: Data is available automatically in 5-minute periods. | No charge.
  - **Detailed monitoring:** Data is available in 1-minute periods. | You are charged per metric that is sent to CloudWatch

## **v1.0.0**: Launched IOMETE Terraform module üöÄ

**üéâ Announcement**
