# Redash - Connecting to IOMETE

Discover the seamless integration of <b>IOMETE</b> with Redash, a powerful Business Intelligence (BI) platform.

## What is Redash?

Redash is also a Business Intelligence (BI) tool, but it focuses on data visualization and collaboration. It is an open-source platform that allows users to connect to various data sources, visualize data, and share insights with others. Redash is designed to be easy to use, even for non-technical users.

The initial step involves connecting a <b>data source</b>. Navigate to the Data Sources management page by clicking the Settings icon and <FlexButton label='New Data Source' primary><Plus size={16} /></FlexButton> button:
