In this guide we explain how to run your first spark job on **IOMETE**.
___

At the console, navigate to **Job** menu and click to `Create New`

For the sake of simplicity let's use public IOMETE spark images. In this example, we are going to use `iomete/spark:3.2.1.0`

This docker image has pre-built `local:///opt/spark/examples/jars/spark-examples_2.12-3.2.1-iomete.jar` contains example spark applications

In the following screenshot, you'll see how to configure main application file and main class. And you also specify how much compute unit you need form the job. **1ICU** is equal to 4cpu/32GB RAM/150GB NVME SSD node.

Hit the `Create` button and that's all. Your job is ready. Job will be run based on the schedule you defined. But, you can also trigger run manually.

To submit your custom job. You need to use the the general public spark image provided iomete and build your own docker image based on that. Then the submitting the custom job process is similar. You just need to specify your own customer docker image, application file path and main class name
