This guide aims to help you get familiar with getting started with writing your first Spark Job and deploying in the IOMETE platform.

:::info
In this guide, we will use a PySpark sample job but, you can use any other language like Scala, Java or other supported languages.
:::
___

## Quickstart

IOMETE provides a [PySpark quickstart template](https://github.com/iomete/spark-job-template) for you to get started with your first Spark Job. You can use this template to get started with your first Spark Job. Please follow the instructions in the `README` file to get started.

## Sample Job

The template already contains a sample job that reads a CSV file from a S3 bucket, run some transformations and writes the output to an Iceberg Table.

:::info
[Apache Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/) is a new open table format for Apache Spark that improves on the existing table formats to provide **ACID** transactions, scalable metadata handling, and a unified specification for both **streaming** and **batch** data.
:::

## How can I use this template?

This template is meant to be used as a starting point for your own jobs. You can use it as follows:

1.  Clone this repository
2.  Modify the code and tests to fit your needs
3.  Build the Docker image and push it to your Docker registry
4.  Create a Spark Job in the Iomete Control Plane
5.  Run the Spark Job
6.  Modify the code and tests as needed
7.  Go to step 3

:::note
If you are just starting with PySpark at IOMETE, you can just explore the sample code without modifying it. It will help you understand process of creating a Spark Job and running it.

## Project Structure

The project is composed of the following folders/files:

-   `infra/`: contains requirements and Dockerfile files
    -   `requirements-dev.txt`: contains the list of python packages to install for development
    -   `requirements.txt`: contains the list of python packages to install for production. This requirements file is used to build the Docker image
    -   `Dockerfile`: contains the Dockerfile to build the spark job image
-   `spark-conf/`: contains the spark configuration files for development environment
    -   `spark-defaults.conf`: contains the spark configuration
    -   `log4j.properties`: contains the log4j configuration for the PySpark job. This file is used to configure the logging level of the job
-   `test_data/`: contains the test data for the job unit/integration tests
-   `job.py`: contains the spark job code. Template comes with a sample code that reads a csv file from S3 and writes the data to a table in the Lakehouse. Feel free to modify the code to fit your needs.
-   `test_job.py`: contains the spark job tests. Template comes with a sample test that reads the test data from `test_data/` and asserts the output of the job. Feel free to modify the tests to fit your needs.
-   `Makefile`: contains the commands to run the job and tests

## How to run the job

First, create a virtual environment and install the dependencies:

```bash
virtualenv .env
source .env/bin/activate

# make sure you have python version 3.7.0 or higher
make install-dev-requirements
```

Also, set the `SPARK_CONF_DIR` environment variable to point to the `spark_conf` folder. This is needed to load the spark configuration files for local development:

```bash
export SPARK_CONF_DIR=./spark_conf
```

Then, you can run the job:

```bash
python job.py
```

## How to run the tests


:::info
Make sure you have installed the dependencies, and exported the `SPARK_CONF_DIR` environment variable as described in the previous section.
:::

To run the tests, you can use the `pytest` command:

```bash
pytest
```

## Deployment

### Build Docker Image

In the Makefile, modify `docker_image` and `docker_tag` variables to match your Docker image name and tag.

:::info
For example, if you push your image to AWS ECR, your docker image name will be something like `123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-image`.
:::

Then, run the following command to build the Docker image:

```bash
make docker-push
```

Once the docker is built and pushed to your Docker registry, you can create a Spark Job in the IOMETE.

### Creating a Spark Job

There are two ways to create a Spark Job in the IOMETE:

1.  Using the Iomete Control Plane UI
2.  Using the Iomete Control Plane API

**Using the IOMETE Control Plane UI**

1.  Go to `Spark Jobs` page
2.  Click on <span className="inline-button"><Plus size={16}/> Create New</span> button
3.  Provide the following information:
    - `Name`: `sample-job`
    - `Image`: `iomete/sample-job:1.0.0`
    - `Main Application File`: `local:///app/job.py`

<Img src="/img/guides/spark-job/getting-started/create-spark-job.png" alt="Create Spark Job"/>

**Using the IOMETE Control Plane API**

First set `WORKSPACE_ENDPOINT` and `API_TOKEN` environment variables. Retrieve

-   `API TOKEN` from here: https://app.iomete.cloud/user-settings/personal-access-token
-   `WORKSPACE_ENDPOINT` from the `Workspace Settings` page and find the value of `Workspace Endpoint`.

```bash
export WORKSPACE_ENDPOINT="<your workspace id>"
export API_TOKEN="<your api token>"
```

```bash
curl -v --request POST \
--url $WORKSPACE_ENDPOINT/spark-jobs \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--header "X-API-TOKEN: $API_TOKEN" \
--data '{
  "name": "sample-job22",
  "template": {
    "spark_version": "3.2.1",
    "image": "iomete/sample-job:1.0.0",
    "main_application_file": "local:///app/job.py"
    }
  }
}'
```

### Run Spark Job

Once the Spark Job is created, you can run it using the Iomete Control Plane UI or API. 

#### Run from UI

To run it from the UI, go to the `Spark Jobs` page, go to the details of job and click on the `Run` button.

#### Run from API

To run it from the API, first set `JOB_ID` environment variable to the ID of the Spark Job you created in the previous step. Then, run the following command:

```bash
# replace the JOB_ID with the ID of the Spark Job you created in the previous step
export JOB_ID="40fcb60a-1cfd-47a9-8a3c-2920fa398326"

curl -v --request POST \
  --url $WORKSPACE_ENDPOINT/spark-jobs/$JOB_ID/runs \
  --header "X-API-TOKEN: $API_TOKEN"
```

You can monitor and check the status of the Spark Job run from the `Spark Job Runs` page:
