<Question title="Using AWS Profiles">A <b>named profile</b> is a collection of settings and credentials that you can apply to an AWS CLI command. When you specify a profile to run a command, the settings and credentials are used to run that command. Multiple <b>named profiles</b> can be stored in the <code>config</code> and <code>credentials</code> files.

For detailed information see:  [Named profiles for the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html)

### Using profile:

After successfully creating Profile (ex. iomete-stage) need to export the profile to the environment before running terraform. ex:

```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=iomete-stage

## Then run terraform code as below

terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

P.S. Using the profile in terraform code will create additional works (ex. need to declare profile name in all providers).

We recommend exporting the profile to the environment before running the code. 

If using only one account (only default profile) no need to export or separate the AWS profile.

Just run the Terraform code.

<Question title="Saving terraform state">By default, Terraform writes its state file to your local filesystem. This works well for personal projects, but once you start working with a team, things start to get more challenging. In a team, you need to make sure everyone has an up to date version of the state file and ensure that two people aren‚Äôt making concurrent changes.

Remote state solves those challenges. Remote state is simply storing that state file remotely, rather than on your local filesystem. With a single state file stored remotely, teams can ensure they always have the most up to date state file. With remote state, Terraform can also lock the state file while changes are being made. This ensures all changes are captured, even if concurrent changes are being attempted.

Configuring remote state in Terraform has always been an involved process. For example, you can store state in an S3 bucket, but you need to create the bucket, properly configure it, set up permissions, and then ensure everyone has proper credentials to write to it.

As a result, setting up remote state can be a stumbling block as teams adopt Terraform.

<Question title="Define additional administrators">AWS Key Management Service (KMS) is an Amazon Web Services product that allows administrators to create, delete and control keys that encrypt data stored in AWS databases and products.

AWS KMS can be accessed within [AWS Identity and Access Management](https://www.techtarget.com/searchaws/definition/Amazon-Web-Services-AWS-Identity-and-Access-Management-IAM) by selecting the "Encryption Keys" section or by using the AWS KMS command-line interface or software development kit

IOMETE customer-stack Terraform module will use or create a KMS key only who run the Terraform code if additional administrator ARN`s not added. (AWS KMS see:[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/overview.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/overview.html) )

Adding an additional administrator to the system will grant them access to manage Kubernetes resources in EKS. By default, only the creator of the resources has access to Kubernetes. To add additional administrators, include their user Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) when running the Terraform code. It is important to note that when adding additional ARNs, the creators must include their own ARNs in the list to ensure that they retain access to the resources.

:::tip
 Example: additional_administrators = ["arn:aws:iam::1234567890:user/your_arn", "arn:aws:iam::1234567890:user/user2", "arn:aws:iam::1234567890:user/user3"]

<Question title="Public Access Restriction">By default, the EKS API (Kubernetes cluster API) is accessible from anywhere. However, it's important to restrict public access to a selected IP range for security reasons. 

The IOMETE control plane connects to and manages the data lakehouse and Spark jobs using the EKS (AWS Kubernetes service) API address. By default, the **`kubernetes_public_access_cidrs`** code in the Terraform script is commented out. However, if you need to restrict public access to the EKS API for security or compliance reasons, follow these steps:

:::note

üí° You will need a static IP address or address range to restrict public access to EKS.

:::note

- Uncomment the **`kubernetes_public_access_cidrs`** in the Terraform script.
- Be sure not to remove IOMETE's IP addresses (**`18.156.67.183/32`** and **`54.235.211.34/32`**). Removing these addresses will prevent the control plane from accessing the cluster, rendering the lakehouse inoperable.
- Add your static IP address (or address range, such as **`5.194.94.20/30`**) to the **`your_ip_range/mask`** section.

:::note
‚ùóÔ∏è Only deployed IP addresses will have access to all resources and EKS instances created by Terraform.
 
:::note

By following these steps, you can restrict public access to your EKS API and ensure that only authorized users can access your IOMETE lakehouse. If you have any questions or need assistance, please don't hesitate to contact our support team.
