Customers can use these static IP addresses to increase the security only opening their SSH access to these addresses
___

We pull data from your sources and send it to your destination using a set of fixed IP addresses. To ensure that **IOMETE** can do this, you must whitelist these IP addresses in your firewall. Use the list below according to the region in which you'd like your **IOMETE** SSH access and whitelist all IPs listed for your region:

### AWS

| Region                                  | IP ADDRESSES (CIDR) | Region host             |
| :-------------------------------------- | :------------------ | :---------------------- |
| **Frankfurt** eu-central-1              | 18.198.120.219/32      | eu-central-1.iomete.com |
| **Oregon** us-west-2                    | 35.85.22.45/32         | us-west-2.iomete.com    |
