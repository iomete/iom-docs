description: Data security at IOMETE ensures controlled access via a user interface. Admins manage permissions for groups/users on databases, tables and columns.
---

Data security at IOMETE maintains access control using a user interface for consistent administration. Security admins set policies for databases, tables, and columns, managing permissions for [groups](/docs/user-guide/iam/groups) or [users](/docs/user-guide/iam/users).

IOMETE's comprehensive security framework is built on Apache Ranger for data access policies and Open Policy Agent (OPA) for control policies, providing enterprise-grade security controls across your data platform. Learn more about the [platform's security architecture](/docs/getting-started/architecture#security).

<hr />

IOMETE has two types of policies: &nbsp; [resource-based](#resource-based-policies) and [tag-based](#tag-based-policies).

### Resource-based policies

Resource-based policies in IOMETE offer a powerful mechanism for enforcing security controls based on the resources being accessed. These policies are managed through Apache Ranger and integrate seamlessly with [IAM roles](/docs/user-guide/iam/roles) and the [Resource Access System (RAS)](/docs/user-guide/iam/ras/ras). These policies cover three key areas:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ whiteSpace: "nowrap" }}>Policy Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style={{ whiteSpace: "nowrap" }}>
        <a href="access-policy">Access Policy</a>
      </td>
      <td>
        An access policy comprises rules and permissions that specify who can
        access specific resources and the actions they can take after gaining
        access.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style={{ whiteSpace: "nowrap" }}>
        <a href="data-masking">Data Masking</a>
      </td>
      <td>
        Data masking is a method to hide sensitive information by changing it
        into fake data while keeping its appearance intact. It safeguards
        private details during testing or sharing.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style={{ whiteSpace: "nowrap" }}>
        <a href="row-level-filter">Row-level Filter</a>
      </td>
      <td>
        Row-level filtering limits who can see certain rows in a database.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Tag-based policies

Tag-based policies in IOMETE allow administrators to manage access controls to resources based on assigned **tags**. Instead of defining policies for individual resources, administrators group resources with similar characteristics under a common tag and apply access controls to the entire tag. This simplifies policy management and allows [users](/docs/user-guide/iam/users) or [groups](/docs/user-guide/iam/groups) to access all resources sharing the same tag with consistent access permissions. Tag-based policies are particularly useful for implementing data classification schemes and applying security controls at scale.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Policy Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style={{ whiteSpace: "nowrap" }}>
        <a href="tag-based-access-policy">Tag-based Access Policy</a>
      </td>
      <td>
        Manage access controls to resources based on assigned tags. Resources
        with similar characteristics share common tags, and access controls are
        applied to the entire tag.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style={{ whiteSpace: "nowrap" }}>
        <a href="tag-based-data-masking">Tag-based Masking Policy</a>
      </td>
      <td>
        Control data masking within resources based on their assigned tags.
        Sensitive data is categorized with tags to indicate sensitivity levels.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Programmatic Access

For automation and integration purposes, IOMETE provides comprehensive API access to security features. Use the [Data Security API](/docs/user-guide/data-security/data-security-api) to programmatically manage access policies, data masking rules, and row-level filters.

## Next Steps

### Setting Up Security for Your Organization

1. **Configure Identity Management**
   - Set up [SSO integration](/docs/user-guide/iam/sso/sso) or [LDAP](/docs/user-guide/iam/ldap-configuration) for centralized authentication
   - Create [IAM users](/docs/user-guide/iam/users) and organize them into [groups](/docs/user-guide/iam/groups)
   - Define [roles](/docs/user-guide/iam/roles) based on job functions and responsibilities

2. **Implement Data Access Controls**
   - Create [Access Policies](/docs/user-guide/data-security/access-policy) to control who can access databases, tables, and columns
   - Set up [Data Masking](/docs/user-guide/data-security/data-masking) to protect sensitive information
   - Configure [Row-Level Filters](/docs/user-guide/data-security/row-level-filter) for fine-grained data access

3. **Apply Tag-Based Security (Advanced)**
   - Implement [Tag-Based Access Policies](/docs/user-guide/data-security/tag-based-access-policy) for scalable security management
   - Configure [Tag-Based Data Masking](/docs/user-guide/data-security/tag-based-data-masking) for sensitive data classification

4. **Automate with APIs**
   - Use the [Data Security API](/docs/user-guide/data-security/data-security-api) to integrate security management into your workflows

### Security Best Practices

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant users only the minimum permissions they need to perform their tasks
- **Regular Access Reviews**: Periodically review and audit user access permissions using the [RAS](/docs/user-guide/iam/ras/ras) system
- **Use Groups Over Individual Permissions**: Assign permissions to [groups](/docs/user-guide/iam/groups) rather than individual [users](/docs/user-guide/iam/users) for easier management
- **Implement Defense in Depth**: Use multiple layers of security (authentication, authorization, masking, filtering)
- **Tag Sensitive Data**: Use [tag-based policies](/docs/user-guide/data-security/tag-based-access-policy) to consistently protect sensitive data across your platform
- **Monitor and Audit**: Regularly review access logs and security events to detect and respond to potential threats
