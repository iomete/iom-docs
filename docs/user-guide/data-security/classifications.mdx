## Overview

Data Classifications help you label tables and columns (for example: `PII`, `Confidential`, `Financial`). These labels are used by security and masking policies.

Because classifications directly affect data access and visibility, they now follow a **request and approval workflow**.

Key changes:

- Classifications must be **predefined by admins or security teams**
- Users **cannot create new classifications**
- Adding or removing a classification requires **approval**
- Every change is tracked through **Classification Requests**

This prevents accidental exposure of sensitive data and avoids breaking pipelines due to unexpected policy changes.

---

## What Changed

Previously, users could freely create and apply tags in the Data Catalog.

Now:

- Tags are replaced by **Classification** Tags
- Only admins can create and manage classifications
- Users can still apply classifications — but only through a **request**
- Admins review and approve or reject those requests

Why this matters:

Each classification may be connected to:

- Tag-based security policies
- Masking rules
- Tag-based masking

Adding or removing a classification can:

- Grant access to sensitive data
- Remove access from users
- Change how data is masked

So every change must be reviewed.

---

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Domain Members

- Browse existing classifications
- Request to add or remove classifications on tables or columns
- Track and manage classification requests

### Admins / Security Admins

- Create and manage classifications
- Review classification requests
- Approve or reject requests
- See where each classification is used across data assets

---

## Classifications (Admin Portal)

Classifications are managed from the **Admin Portal → Data Security → Classifications**.

  alt="Data Classifications in Admin Portal"
  borderless
/>

Each classification includes:

- Name
- Description
- Usage count (how many assets use it)
- List of attached tables and columns

Admins use this area to:

- Create classifications
- Understand impact before making changes
- See where sensitive labels are applied

---

## Browsing Classifications inside Domain (Data Catalog)

All users can view available classifications from the **Classifications tab** in the Data Catalog.

This is a read-only view.

You can:

- Search classifications
- Read descriptions
- Understand what each classification represents

---

## Requesting Classification Changes (Users)

Domain members can request to:

- Add a classification to a table or column
- Remove a classification from a table or column

### How to submit a request

1. Open a table or column in the Data Catalog
2. Choose the classification action (add or remove)
3. Submit the request

The change is **not applied immediately**.

Instead, a request is created for admin review.

---

## Classification Requests

All requests are visible in the **Classification Requests** tab.

Users can:

- Track request status (Pending / Approved / Rejected)
- View reviewer comments
- Cancel pending requests

Admins can:

- Review requests
- Approve or reject
- Add comments explaining decisions

This creates a clear audit trail for every classification change.

---

## Approval Flow (Admins)

When a request is submitted:

1. Admins or Security Admins receive it
2. They review the affected assets and classification
3. They approve or reject the request
4. If approved, the classification is applied automatically
5. If rejected, the requester sees the reason

This ensures sensitive changes are always reviewed.

## API Changes

Data Catalog APIs have been updated to support:

- Classifications
- Request / approval workflow
- Usage tracking

**[PLACEHOLDER — Updated Data Catalog API documentation]**

## Example Workflow: Classifying PII Data

This example shows how a typical PII classification flows from discovery to enforcement.

**Scenario:**

A data analyst discovers that a customer table contains personally identifiable information (PII), such as email addresses and phone numbers. That data must be classified so masking and access controls can apply.

---

### Step 1 — User Identifies Sensitive Columns

1. Open the table in the Data Catalog.
2. Review column contents (for example: `email`, `phone_number`).
3. Select the relevant columns.
4. Request to apply the **PII** classification.

At this point, nothing changes yet. A request is created for review.

/>

---

### Step 2 — Classification Request Is Created

The system creates a Classification Request that includes:

- Requested classification (PII)
- Target assets (table / columns)
- Requester
- Justification
- Timestamp

The requester can track progress in **Classification Requests**.

  alt="View Pending request"
  borderless
/>

---

### Step 3 — Admin Reviews the Request

An Admin or Security Admin opens the request and reviews:

- Which columns are affected
- Whether PII is appropriate
- Downstream impact (masking rules, access policies)

They can:

- Approve the request
- Reject the request with a comment

Example rejection comment:

> “Phone number column confirmed, but email is already masked by another policy. Please verify.”

---

### Step 4 — Classification Is Applied Automatically

If approved:

- The PII classification is attached to the selected columns
- Existing security and masking policies linked to PII take effect immediately

Typical outcomes:

- Unauthorized users lose access to raw values
- Masking is applied automatically
- Audit trail is updated

No manual policy changes are required.

---

### Step 5 — User Sees Final Status

The requester sees the request marked **Approved** (or **Rejected**) along with reviewer comments.
