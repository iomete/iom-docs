A **Spark Catalog** is a component in Apache Spark that manages metadata for tables and databases within a Spark session. It allows for the creation, deletion, and querying of tables, as well as access to their schemas and properties.

IOMETE allows users to configure multiple **Spark Catalogs** to access data from both IOMETE systems and external sources. This configuration supports lakehouse queries and Spark jobs, streamlining data retrieval and management across diverse environments.

### Catalog Overview

To view all configured Spark Catalogs, navigate to the `Settings` menu item and switch to the `Spark Catalogs` tab.
In the list below, you'll find the Spark catalog. The default catalog created by the system is called `spark_catalog`.

### Configuring Managed Catalogs

IOMETE enables the creation of new catalogs that operate as Iceberg REST Catalogs, managed internally by the IOMETE system.
These catalogs are accessible to external tools via the path `/catalogs/<catalog name>`.
They seamlessly integrate with existing data security rules to enforce role-based access control (RBAC).
For authentication, a session or a [PAT token](../create-a-personal-access-token.md) is required.

#### Creating a new Managed Catalog

To add new catalog item, click `Create` button in the top right corner. You'll see following screen:

## Catalog Types Overview

IOMETE supports both **internally managed catalogs** and **external catalogs** that can be integrated for a seamless data experience across different environments. Below is an overview of the various types of catalogs you can configure.

These are the catalogs managed internally by the IOMETE system.

### IOMETE Managed Catalogs

Catalogs managed internally by the IOMETE platform. These catalogs integrate with Data Security for RBAC and are accessible by both IOMETE workloads and external compute engines.

<Card title="Iceberg REST Catalog" link="user-guide/spark-catalogs/internal">
  A fully managed Iceberg REST Catalog with support for external access,
  access delegation (credential vending and remote signing), and operational controls.
</Card>

<Card title="Enterprise Catalog" link="user-guide/spark-catalogs/enterprise">
  A streamlined catalog type for internal IOMETE workloads with
  auto-configured connection properties.
</Card>

</GridBox>

### External Spark Catalogs

IOMETE seamlessly connects to `external` Iceberg catalogs, allowing you to integrate with your existing data infrastructure while continuing to manage metadata and data in external systems. This integration lets you leverage IOMETE’s powerful capabilities without the need to relocate your data.

Supported external Iceberg catalogs include `REST` APIs, `AWS Glue`, and `Nessie` catalogs. To learn how to configure each type of catalog, follow the links below.

<Card title="JDBC Catalog" link="user-guide/spark-catalogs/external-jdbc">
  This catalog connects to an existing JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
  resource, which facilitates communication with relational database management
  systems (RDBMS)
</Card>

<Card
  title="REST Iceberg Catalog"
  link="user-guide/spark-catalogs/external-rest"
>
  An external Iceberg catalog connected via REST API integration. This type of
  catalog allows you to connect IOMETE to any REST-compliant Iceberg metadata
  storage.
</Card>

<Card
  title="AWS Glue Iceberg Catalog"
  link="user-guide/spark-catalogs/external-glue"
>
  This catalog connects IOMETE to Iceberg metadata stored in AWS Glue,
  leveraging AWS Glue’s cataloging features to manage schemas and metadata for
  Iceberg tables.
</Card>

<Card
  title="Nessie Iceberg Catalog"
  link="user-guide/spark-catalogs/external-nessie"
>
  The Nessie catalog provides version control for your Iceberg tables, with
  Git-like operations for branching and managing table versions.
</Card>

## New Catalog in SQL Editor.

After c SQL Editor to view the Spark catalog that has been created.
Check out the `SQL Editior` section in the left panel. If you don't see the created catalog, please refresh by using the <ArrowsClockwise size={16} /> button.
In the given image, we have already created some databases and tables inside the catalog.

:::tip Connecting from External Applications
For details on connecting external compute engines (PySpark, Starburst, Teradata) to IOMETE catalogs, see the [Iceberg REST Catalog](./internal.md#connecting-from-external-applications) documentation.
