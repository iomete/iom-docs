## Database explorer

Database explorer panel is used to explore your database objects, which includes **namespaces, tables, views,** and their **columns** (even complex columns), and partitions.

To view database objects, expand a database. Each object in the database explorer has a corresponding options menu <DotsThreeVertical size={16} weight="bold" className="bg-emphasis-300"/> .

The options menu lets you:

- Place the query `SELECT * FROM database.table LIMIT 100;` (tables and views only)
- Place the query `DESC EXTENDED database.table;` (tables and views only)
- Copy of object name `Copy`

## Worksheets

The worksheet is a document that stores all SQL statements.

**Welcome** worksheet - This worksheet was created for you when you first started SQL Editor.
When you make changes to a worksheet it will save automatically after a delay of 5 seconds.

In the **Worksheet** panel, you can:

- Open a worksheet in the SQL editor
- Rename a worksheet
- Duplicate a worksheet
- Delete a worksheet
- Search your set of worksheets by name

### Querying data

:::info
Before running a query you must select a running **[Lakehouse](https://iomete.com/docs/user-guide/virtual-lakehouses)** and **Database**.
:::

To select (or change) the Running lakehouse for a worksheet, click the `Select Lakehouse` dropdown in the upper-right corner of the query editor.

To select (or change) the current database for a worksheet, click the `Select Database` dropdown in the upper-right corner of the query editor.

**Write query**

As you enter your script in the query editor, the autocomplete feature suggests:

- Query syntax keywords such as SQL functions or aliases.
- Values that match table or column names within a schema.

IOMETE tracks table aliases and suggests them as autocomplete options. For example, if you execute a query using `cities as c` or `cities c` as an alias, the next time you type `c`, the autocomplete feature suggests the alias as an option.

If you want to open autocomplete, use the given shortcut:

- ⌘+Space (Mac)
- Ctrl+Space (Windows)

:::

Using the query editor, run a single query as follows:

- Click `Run` button
- ⌘+Enter (Mac)

## Query Histories

When you run a query, it is tracked as a new item in the SQL history. You can use the SQL history to go back to previous queries so that you can see query results and open queries in the active worksheet.

<Img src="/img/user-guide/sql-editor/sql-editor-history-1.png" alt="IOMETE SQL Editor - Query histories"/>

## Query Variables

Use variables in your SQL queries by wrapping them in double curly braces, like `{{id}}` .

- **Speeding up queries:** It suggests ways to make SQL queries run faster and more efficiently.

- **Quick suggestions:** It predicts and suggests SQL words, namespaces, tables and more as users type, cutting down on errors and speeding up writing.

- **Exploring data:** It makes it easier to understand databases by showing how tables relate and what information they hold.
