IOMETE provides flexibility to customize the Kubernetes Volume types used in Spark workloads.
Volumes are a critical part of Spark infrastructure—they power shuffle operations, RDD/DataFrame caching, disk spill, 
and more.

Because Spark heavily relies on volumes for performance and stability, the speed and reliability of Spark applications 
or compute clusters are only as strong as the underlying volume configuration.

## Volume list

To see the available volumes, go to the `Settings` menu and click on the `Volumes` tab.

<!-- Click on the <button className="button button--primary button-iom">Configure</button> button to get started. -->

## Create volume

Platform admins can create new type of volumes. To create a new volume go to admin console, click the <button 
className="button button--primary button-iom"><Plus size={16}/>New Volume</button> button.

In the **Create Volume** screen, you can choose from four volume types:

- [Host Path](#host-path): Mounts a directory from the host (node) machine’s filesystem directly into the pod.  
- [On Demand PVC](#on-demand-pvc): Dynamically creates and mounts a persistent volume claim for each pod.  
- [TMPFS](#tmpfs): Provides a temporary, memory-backed filesystem inside the container (fast but ephemeral).  
- [EmptyDir](#emptydir): Creates a temporary directory on the host (node) machine’s filesystem, which lasts only for the
 lifetime of the pod.  

### Host Path

A HostPath volume in Kubernetes is a special type of volume that mounts a file or directory from the host node’s 
filesystem directly into a pod.

However, HostPath comes with important limitations and risks:
- **No storage limits**: You cannot enforce quotas on how much space the pod consumes. 
- **No automatic cleanup**: If the application (e.g., a compute cluster or Spark job) terminates without removing its 
data, those files remain on the node, which can eventually lead to node disk-full issues. 
- **Security concerns**: Since HostPath exposes parts of the host’s filesystem, misconfiguration or misuse can 
compromise the node’s integrity.

Because of these drawbacks, for most workloads, it is recommended to use safer alternatives such as EmptyDir, 
PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs), or tmpfs.

**Configuration**:

- Provide directory on host(node) to be mounted to the pods.

- **Resource tags** are custom name/value pairs that you can assign to IOMETE resources. These tags enable you to 
categorize and organize your resources effectively.

### On Demand PVC

An On-Demand PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) in Kubernetes is a way for pods to request persistent storage that is 
automatically provisioned by a StorageClass. Instead of pre-creating volumes, the cluster dynamically allocates the 
required storage from the underlying infrastructure (e.g., local disks, cloud block storage, or CSI drivers) when the 
PVC is created.

On Demand PVC offers several advantages:
- **Automatic provisioning**: Volumes are created and bound to PVCs on demand, removing the need for manual 
  PersistentVolume(PV) management. 
- **Storage guarantees**: You can define the requested size and access mode, ensuring predictable resource allocation. 
- **Lifecycle management**: Depending on the reclaimPolicy of the StorageClass, volumes can be automatically deleted 
or retained when the PVC is removed. 
- **Isolation & safety**: Unlike HostPath, each PVC-backed volume is isolated, and quotas can prevent uncontrolled 
disk usage.

**Configuration**:
- **Storage class name:** Name for storage class. Available list of storage classes can be retrieved with `kubectl get storageclass` command.
- **Max size:** Maximum storage capacity requested in a PVC per executor.

### TMPFS

TMPFS volumes stores data in the node’s RAM instead of on disk. This means the volume is created when a pod starts and 
exists only while the pod is running. All data is lost when the pod is removed.

Key characteristics:
- **Memory-backed**: Data is stored in RAM (tmpfs), offering very fast read/write performance compared to disk.
- **Ephemeral**: The volume and its contents are automatically deleted when the pod stops or restarts.
- **Space limits**: By default, usage is limited by the pod’s memory requests/limits, preventing it from consuming all
node memory.
- **Use cases**: Ideal for temporary, high-speed scratch space such as caches, buffers, or intermediate computation 
results.

For workloads that need fast but ephemeral storage, tmpfs-backed emptyDir provides a safe and efficient option without 
touching the host’s filesystem or requiring persistent storage.

> ⚠️ **Warning:** Since TMPFS uses the container's memory, enabling it for Spark's local storage will increase the 
> memory usage of your Spark pods. To accommodate this, you may need to adjust the memory overhead allocated to Spark's 
> driver and executor pods by configuring `spark.{driver,executor}.memoryOverheadFactor`. This ensures that your Spark 
> workloads have enough memory to handle both their regular tasks and the additional overhead introduced by using TMPFS.

**Configuration**:
- **Max size:** The maximum storage limit for the volume, specified in units such as `GiB`.  
This value acts as an upper bound, not a reservation — the actual available storage depends on the node’s memory 
capacity.

### EmptyDir

EmptyDir is a temporary storage space that Kubernetes creates when a pod is assigned to a node. 
The volume initially starts empty and is deleted automatically when the pod is removed. By default, data is stored on 
the node’s backing storage (e.g., local SSD, HDD, or node filesystem).

Key characteristics:
- **Ephemeral:** The data lives only for the lifetime of the pod. Once the pod is deleted or rescheduled, all contents 
are lost.  
- **Disk-backed:** Data is written to the node’s disk, making it slower than TMPFS but suitable for larger temporary 
data.  
- **Storage capacity:** The size is limited by the available disk space on the node. Per-pod usage limit can be 
defined.
- **Use cases:** Good for temporary files, caching, scratch space, or intermediate results that do not need to survive 
beyond the pod’s lifecycle.  

> ⚠️ **Warning:** Since `EmptyDir` volumes use the node’s local storage, excessive consumption can fill the node’s disk 
> and cause other workloads to fail. Always monitor ephemeral storage usage or configure pod-level ephemeral storage 
> limits.

**Configuration**:
- **Max size:** The maximum storage limit for the volume, specified in units such as `GiB`.  
This value acts as an upper bound, not a reservation — the actual available storage depends on the node’s capacity.  
If omitted, the volume can grow without a defined limit (constrained only by the node’s available storage).

## Using volumes

You can utilize node types in [Lakehouses](./virtual-lakehouses.md), [Spark Connect Clusters](./spark-connect.md) and [Spark Jobs](../developer-guide/spark-job/getting-started.md).
Let's navigate to the [Lakehouse create](./virtual-lakehouses.md#create-a-new-lakehouse) page. Here, you'l find options for `Volume` which include volume selections.

## Delete volume

To delete a volume, locate it in the volumes list, click the "Edit" button, and then click the <button className="button button--danger button--outline button-iom"><Trash size={16} /> Delete</button> button below the inputs. Afterward, you'll receive a confirmation message; click "Yes, delete" to confirm the deletion.
