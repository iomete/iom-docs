IOMETE warehouse JDBC endpoints are compatible with Hive JDBC drivers. But due to recent SSL issues, we have released a fixed version of the driver. If you wish to use the JDBC driver must download it from our GitHub repository and include it as a library in their project


### Download the Driver
Visit our GitHub repository [iomete-artifacts](https://github.com/iomete/iomete-artifacts) and download the latest version of the Hive JDBC driver hive-jdbc-3.1.3-standalone.jar.

### Using JDBC driver for DataGrip connection

- **Registering the IOMETE Driver to DataGrip** 

  1. Open DataGrip and click on the `Data Source Properties` button from the toolbar. Or from the menu, `File` -> `Data Sources`.
