IOMETE warehouse JDBC endpoints are compatible with Hive JDBC drivers. But due to recent SSL issues, we have released a fixed version of the driver. If you wish to use the JDBC driver must download it from our GitHub repository and include it as a library in their project.

## Download the Driver
Visit our GitHub repository [iomete-artifacts](https://github.com/iomete/iomete-artifacts) and download the latest version of the Hive JDBC driver `hive-jdbc-3.1.3-standalone.jar`.

## Using JDBC driver in Java project
To use the JDBC driver in your Java project, include the driver as a library in your project. You can use Maven to include the driver in your project.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.hive</groupId>
    <artifactId>hive-jdbc</artifactId>
    <version>4.0.1</version>
    <scope>system</scope>
    <systemPath>${project.basedir}/src/main/resources/hive-jdbc-4.0.1-standalone.jar</systemPath>
</dependency>
```
