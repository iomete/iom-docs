## **Release 1.11.2**:

- **Pod Security Context**: Added securityContext settings to all pods, ensuring that all resources are running as non-root users.
  •	Note that Spark images requires root user only if using default hostPath volumes, which can be adjusted from Volume Settings in the IOMETE Console by choosing Dynamic PVC.  
  •	Currently, only Apache Ranger requires root user permissions, which will be addressed in a future release.  
- **Eliminated Assets Bucket**: We have eliminated additional bucket created/used for assets, which was previously required for storing assets like 'sql query results', 'spark history data', etc. Now, assets are stored in the same bucket as the data lake.  
- **Role/Permissions Settings**: Redesigned and improved role/permissions settings for better user management and access control.  
  •	Updated permissions page desing for better user experience.  
  •	IAM Settings now controlled by two permissions: View and Manage. Previously each component of IAM settings (Users / Groups / Roles) managed by separate permissions.  
  •	Data Security / Data Catalog: List and View actions combined into a single `View` permission. Create and Manage actions combined into a single `Manage` permission.  
  •	Added new permission for Spark Settings.  
  •	Added new permission for Data Plane Settings.  
- **Logging Source**: Users now have the flexibility to choose their logging source. Previously, only Loki was supported. Now, users can choose between Kubernetes, Loki, and Elasticsearch.  
  •	Kubernetes: Displays logs only for active/current resources and does not include historical data (e.g., logs for terminated resources are not available).  
  •	Elasticsearch: Requires an SSL connection and an API key for authentication.  
- Iceberg upgraded to 1.5.  
- Ranger now operates as non-root with `securityContext` configuration.  
- Added **Requests** and **Limits** to all IOMETE Kubernetes resources.  
- Iceberg: Fixed the issue with reading parquet time_micros fields defined as bigint in the schema by adding BigIntVector allocation in VectorizedArrowReader.  


## **Release 1.9.0**:

- **LDAP Configuration:** The IOMETE Console now supports LDAP configuration, offering a more streamlined and secure way to manage user access and authentication.  
- **Advanced Spark Catalog Options:** Additional configuration capabilities have been introduced for Spark Catalog registration, providing more flexibility and control to users.  
- **Custom Node Pool Configuration:** Users can now tailor node pool settings to their specific needs, allowing for optimized resource allocation and usage.  
- **Resource Tagging:** The ability to add tags to various resources within the IOMETE Console improves resource management, making it easier to categorize and track Lakehouse, Spark Connect, Spark Jobs, etc.  
- **Spark Connect Clusters - Connection Stability**: Issues affecting Spark Connect Cluster connections, particularly from Jupyter notebooks and Windows environments, have been addressed.  
- **Spark Operator Webhook Configuration**: This can now be deployed separately. This also enabled removing ClusterRole requirements from the base Helm chart.  
- **Removed Cluster Role**: The Cluster Role previously required (to control MutatingAdmissionWebhookConfiguration) for the spark-operator is removed from the base Helm chart.  
- **User Permissions**: Spark clusters previously running under root user permissions are now configured to operate under non-root user permissions.  
- **Grafana Metrics**: The hardcoded namespace issue in the Grafana monitoring dashboard has been resolved.  
- **Bug Fixes**: Various minor issues from the last release, including Spark URL problems, have been resolved.  
- **Volume Settings**: Users can now adjust volume settings directly from the IOMETE Console. This includes selecting volume configurations for each Spark resource, with options for hostpath, dynamic PVC, and size specifications on a per-resource basis.
