The `CREATE TABLE` statement defines a new table
___


### **Syntax**

```sql
CREATE TABLE [ IF NOT EXISTS ] table_identifier
    [ ( col_name1 col_type1 [ COMMENT col_comment1 ], ... ) ]
    USING data_source
    [ OPTIONS ( key1=val1, key2=val2, ... ) ]
    [ PARTITIONED BY ( col_name1, col_name2, ... ) ]
    [ CLUSTERED BY ( col_name3, col_name4, ... ) 
        [ SORTED BY ( col_name [ ASC | DESC ], ... ) ] 
        INTO num_buckets BUCKETS ]
    [ LOCATION path ]
    [ COMMENT table_comment ]
    [ TBLPROPERTIES ( key1=val1, key2=val2, ... ) ]
    [ AS select_statement ]
```
---

### **Parameters**

  * **table_identifier**
  Specifies a table name, which may be optionally qualified with a database name.
  **Syntax:** `[ database_name. ] table_name`
  * **USING data_source**
  Data Source is the input format used to create the table. Data source can be DELTA, CSV, TXT, ORC, JDBC, PARQUET, etc. 
  **NOTE:** Use DELTA if the table is mutable and update, merge statements will be used.
  * **PARTITIONED BY**
  Partitions are created on the table, based on the columns specified.
  * **CLUSTERED BY**
  Partitions created on the table will be bucketed into fixed buckets based on the column specified for bucketing.
  **NOTE:** Bucketing is an optimization technique that uses buckets (and bucketing columns) to determine data partitioning and avoid data shuffle.
  * **SORTED BY**
  Determines the order in which the data is stored in buckets. Default is Ascending order.
  * **LOCATION**
  Path to the directory where table data is stored, which could be a path on distributed storage like HDFS, etc.
  * **COMMENT**
  A string literal to describe the table.
  * **TBLPROPERTIES**
  A list of key-value pairs that is used to tag the table definition.
  * **AS select_statement**
  The table is populated using the data from the select statement.

**Examples**

:::info
Insert/update/merge operation only supported with deltadeltaprovider. It's always recommended to create tables with delta provider
:::

```sql
CREATE IF NOT EXISTS TABLE events (
  date DATE,
  eventId STRING,
  eventType STRING,
  data STRING)
USING DELTA;


CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE events (
  date DATE,
  eventId STRING,
  eventType STRING,
  data STRING)
USING DELTA
```

You can also use `CREATE TABLE AS` with a `SELECT` command to copy data from an existing table:


```sql 
CREATE TABLE sessions_dm USING delta
AS SELECT *
FROM sessions
WHERE category IS NOT NULL ;

DESC TABLE sessions_dm;

+-------------+------------+----------+
|  col_name   | data_type  | comment  |
+-------------+------------+----------+
| id          | int        | NULL     |
| start_date  | timestamp  | NULL     |
| end_date    | timestamp  | NULL     |
| category    | int        | NULL     |
+-------------+------------+----------+

SELECT * FROM sessions_dm;

+-----+------------------------+--------------------------+-----------+
| id  |       start_date       |         end_date         | category  |
+-----+------------------------+--------------------------+-----------+
| 1   | 2020-04-02 14:05:15.4  | 2020-04-03 14:25:15.4    | 1         |
| 3   | 2020-04-02 14:05:15.4  | 2020-04-04 16:57:53.653  | 3         |
+-----+------------------------+--------------------------+-----------+
```

**Partition data**

You can partition data to speed up queries or DML that have predicates involving the partition columns. To partition data when you create a Delta table, specify partition by columns. A common pattern is to partition by date, for example:

```sql
-- Create table in the metastore
CREATE TABLE events (
  date DATE,
  eventId STRING,
  eventType STRING,
  data STRING)
USING DELTA
PARTITIONED BY (date)
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE sessions_dm 
  USING delta
  PARTITIONED BY (category)
AS SELECT *
FROM sessions
WHERE category IS NOT NULL;
```
