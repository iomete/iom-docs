### Writing with SQL

**IOMETE** supports `INSERT INTO`, `MERGE INTO`, and `INSERT OVERWRITE`

<br/>

### `INSERT INTO`

To append new data to a table, use `INSERT INTO`.

```sql
INSERT INTO db.table VALUES (1, 'a'), (2, 'b')
```

```sql
INSERT INTO db.table SELECT ...
```

<br/>

### `MERGE INTO`

`MERGE INTO` queries that can express row-level updates.

Iceberg supports `MERGE INTO` by rewriting data files that contain rows that need to be updated in an `overwrite` commit.

:::info
**MERGE INTO is recommended instead of INSERT OVERWRITE** because Iceberg can replace only the affected data files, and because the data overwritten by a dynamic overwrite may change if the table’s partitioning changes.
:::

<br/>

### `MERGE INTO syntax`

`MERGE INTO` updates a table, called the target table, using a set of updates from another query, called the source. The update for a row in the target table is found using the `ON` clause that is like a join condition. 

```sql
MERGE INTO db.target t   -- a target table
USING (SELECT ...) s          -- the source updates
ON t.id = s.id                -- condition to find updates for target rows
WHEN ...                      -- updates
```

Updates to rows in the target table are listed using `WHEN MATCHED ... THEN ....` Multiple `MATCHED` clauses can be added with conditions that determine when each match should be applied. The first matching expression is used.

```sql
WHEN MATCHED AND s.op = 'delete' THEN DELETE
WHEN MATCHED AND t.count IS NULL AND s.op = 'increment' THEN UPDATE SET t.count = 0
WHEN MATCHED AND s.op = 'increment' THEN UPDATE SET t.count = t.count + 1
```

Source rows (updates) that do not match can be inserted:

```sql
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT *
```
Inserts also support additional conditions:

```sql
WHEN NOT MATCHED AND s.event_time > still_valid_threshold THEN INSERT (id, count) VALUES (s.id, 1)
```

Only one record in the source data can update any given row of the target table, or else an error will be thrown.

<br/>

### INSERT OVERWRITE

`INSERT OVERWRITE` can replace data in the table with the result of a query. Overwrites are atomic operations for Iceberg tables.

The partitions that will be replaced by `INSERT OVERWRITE` depends on Spark’s partition overwrite mode and the partitioning of a table. `MERGE INTO` can rewrite only affected data files and has more easily understood behavior, so it is recommended instead of `INSERT OVERWRITE.`

<br/>

### Overwrite behavior

Spark’s default overwrite mode is **static**, but **dynamic overwrite mode is recommended when writing to Iceberg tables**. Static overwrite mode determines which partitions to overwrite in a table by converting the `PARTITION` clause to a filter, but the `PARTITION` clause can only reference table columns.

Dynamic overwrite mode is configured by setting `spark.sql.sources.partitionOverwriteMode=dynamic.`

To demonstrate the behavior of dynamic and static overwrites, consider a `logs` table defined by the following DDL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE my_app.logs (
    uuid string NOT NULL,
    level string NOT NULL,
    ts timestamp NOT NULL,
    message string)
PARTITIONED BY (level, hours(ts))
```
<br/>

### Dynamic overwrite

When Spark’s overwrite mode is dynamic, partitions that have rows produced by the `SELECT` query will be replaced.

For example, this query removes duplicate log events from the example `logs` table.

```sql
INSERT OVERWRITE my_app.logs
SELECT uuid, first(level), first(ts), first(message)
FROM prod.my_app.logs
WHERE cast(ts as date) = '2020-07-01'
GROUP BY uuid
```

In dynamic mode, this will replace any partition with rows in the `SELECT` result. Because the date of all rows is restricted to 1 July, only hours of that day will be replaced.

<br/>

### Static overwrite

When Spark’s overwrite mode is static, the `PARTITION` clause is converted to a filter that is used to delete from the table. If the `PARTITION` clause is omitted, all partitions will be replaced.

Because there is no `PARTITION` clause in the query above, it will drop all existing rows in the table when run in static mode, but will only write the logs from 1 July.

To overwrite just the partitions that were loaded, add a `PARTITION` clause that aligns with the `SELECT` query filter:

```sql
INSERT OVERWRITE my_app.logs
PARTITION (level = 'INFO')
SELECT uuid, first(level), first(ts), first(message)
FROM prod.my_app.logs
WHERE level = 'INFO'
GROUP BY uuid
```

Note that this mode cannot replace hourly partitions like the dynamic example query because the `PARTITION` clause can only reference table columns, not hidden partitions.

<br/>

### `DELETE FROM`

Delete queries accept a filter to match rows to delete.

```sql
DELETE FROM prod.db.table
WHERE ts >= '2020-05-01 00:00:00' and ts < '2020-06-01 00:00:00'
```

If the delte filter matches entire partitions of the table, Iceberg will perform a metadata-only delete. If the filter matches individual rows of a table, then Iceberg will rewrite only the affected data files.

<br/>

### Writing to partitioned tables

Iceberg requires the data to be sorted according to the partition spec per task (Spark partition) in prior to write against partitioned table.  

Let’s go through writing the data against below sample table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE db.sample (
    id bigint,
    data string,
    category string,
    ts timestamp)
PARTITIONED BY (days(ts), category)
```

To write data to the sample table, your data needs to be sorted by `days(ts)`, category.
If you’re inserting data with SQL statement, you can use `ORDER BY` to achieve it, like below:

```sql
INSERT INTO db.sample
SELECT id, data, category, ts FROM another_table
ORDER BY ts, category
```

## Type compatibility

Spark and Iceberg support different set of types. Iceberg does the type conversion automatically, but not for all combinations, so you may want to understand the type conversion in Iceberg in prior to design the types of columns in your tables.

### Spark type to Iceberg type
This type conversion table describes how Spark types are converted to the Iceberg types. The conversion applies on both creating Iceberg table and writing to Iceberg table via Spark.

:::info
The table is based on representing conversion during creating table. In fact, broader supports are applied on write. Here’re some points on write:
* Iceberg numeric types (`integer` , `long` , `float` , `double` , `decimal`) support promotion during writes. e.g. You can write Spark types short, byte, integer, long to Iceberg type long.
* You can write to Iceberg fixed type using Spark binary type. Note that assertion on the length will be performed.
