## Architecture Overview

IOMETE is a Data Lakehouse Platform that provides a unified data platform for AI and Analytics.
It is built on top of Apache Spark, Iceberg, and Kubernetes. IOMETE is designed to be a scalable, reliable, and high-performance platform for data processing and analytics.

## High-Level Architecture

IOMETE runs on top of Kubernetes, which can be deployed on any cloud provider or on-premises data center. IOMETE uses Object Storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage, Minio) as the storage layer for data.

Inside Kubenetes, IOMETE is deployed and provides a set of services that are used to manage data, run Spark jobs, and provide a SQL interface to query and process data.

## Inside Data Plane - IOMETE Services

If we dive deeper into the IOMETE services, we can see the following components:

- **Microservices:** IOMETE is built on top of microservices architecture. Each service is responsible for a specific task, such as managing metadata, running Spark jobs, or providing a SQL interface. In the diagram below, bluish boxes represent microservices.
- **Workloads:** These are the actual workloads based on Spark Engine that serves different purposes.

### Microservices

**1. IOMETE Gateway:** IOMETE Gateway is the entry point to the IOMETE platform. It's a reverse proxy that routes requests to the appropriate microservices.

#### Control Plane Services

- **2. Core Service:** Core Service is the main service that manages metadata, scheduling, and orchestration of workloads.
- **3. IAM Service:** IAM Service is responsible for managing users, groups, and permissions, as well as managing other IDP integrations, such as LDAP, SAML, etc. See [Identity and Access Management](../user-guide/users).
- **4. SQL Service:** SQL Service provides REST API for SQL and also provides a backend for the SQL Editor. See [SQL Editor](../user-guide/sql-editor).
- **5. Catalog Service:** Catalog Service is a backend service for Data Catalog. Which provides metadata management, data discovery, tagging, and lineage.
- **6. Spark Operator:** Spark Operator is a Kubernetes operator that manages all Spark Workloads. It schedules, monitors, and manages the lifecycle of Spark clusters.

#### Security

- **7. Data Access Policies (Ranger):** Data Access Policies is a service that manages data access policies for databases, tables, and columns. It provides a consistent way to manage permissions for groups or users. See [Data Security](../user-guide/data-security/overview).
- **8. Control Policies (OPA):** Control Policies is a service that manages control policies for the platform. It provides a way to manage platform-level policies, such as who can create lakehouses, who can run Spark jobs, etc. See [Control Policies](../user-guide/roles).
- **9. IDP - Identity Provider (Keycloak):** IDP is a service that manages user storage, authentication, and integration powered by Keycloak.

#### Catalogs

- **10. Hive Metastore:** Hive Metastore is a service that manages metadata for Parquet, CSV, JSON, Hive Tables, etc. It provides a way to store metadata for Hive tables and partitions.
- **11. Iceberg Catalog:** Iceberg Catalog is a service that manages metadata for Iceberg Tables.

#### Monitoring

- **12. Spark History:** Spark History is a service that provides Spark job history and monitoring. It's useful for debugging and monitoring completed Spark jobs.
- **13. Prometheus/Loki/Grafana:** Prometheus, Loki, and Grafana are services that provide monitoring, logging, and visualization for the platform and workloads.

### Workloads

- **Lakehouse Clusters:** Lakehouse Clusters are the clusters that provide SQL interface that can be connected from any SQL client, BI tools (e.g., Tableau, PowerBI), DBT, or any other tool that supports JDBC/ODBC. See [Lakehouses](../user-guide/virtual-lakehouses).
- **Spark Connect Clusters:** Spark Connect Clusters are the clusters that provide remote Spark endpoints. Using the connection, you can connect to Spark from anywhere and execute Spark code (DataFrames, SQL, etc.). See [Spark Connect Clusters](../user-guide/spark-connect).
- **Spark Jobs:** Spark Jobs are the Spark jobs that are submitted to the Spark Engine for execution. See [Spark Jobs](../developer-guide/spark-job/getting-started).
- **Jupyter Remote Kernel:** Jupyter Remote Kernel is the Jupyter Kernel that can be connected from any Jupyter Notebook to execute code remotely (e.g., ML training, data processing). See [Jupyter Remote Kernel](../developer-guide/getting-started-with-jupyter-notebook).
