## The Evolutionary Journey: From Data Warehouses to Data Lakehouses

**Evolution of Technology: Divergence to Convergence**

In technology, we often see a pattern of divergence followed by convergence. This is the case with data storage and processing technologies as well. Let's look at how this pattern has played out in the data space.

## 80's, 90's: The Era of Data Warehouses

![History of Data Lakehouse - Warehouses](/img/blog/from-data-warehouses-to-data-lakehouses/history-data-warehouses.png)

**Data Warehouses: The Foundations of Modern Analytics**

Let's start with good old technologies and data warehouses that have been well-known for decades.

Data warehouses are similar to traditional databases or RDBMS systems but specifically designed to handle wide-column analytical systems.

They focus heavily on querying large datasets, which differs from traditional RDBMS systems optimized for pinpoint, ID-based lookups.

This distinction led to the development of ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, as the data models in data warehousing needed to be different from those in traditional databases.

**Summarizing the critical characteristics of data warehouses:**

- Similar to operational RDMS systems but optimized for analytical workloads
- Focus on querying large datasets
- Wide column tables
- Model differences between operational and analytical systems necessitate ETL processes

## 2000's: Hadoop Era

![History of Data Lakehouse - Hadoop](/img/blog/from-data-warehouses-to-data-lakehouses/history-data-hadoop.png)

Enter the 2000s, and the landscape began to change dramatically with the introduction of Hadoop, inspired by Google's MapReduce paper. Hadoop was designed to answer the new Big Data needs:

### Variety of Data

The rise of unstructured data presented unique challenges. Traditional RDBMS systems were well-equipped for structured data but fell short when it came to the new forms of data flooding the digital space. The volume of data skyrocketed, driven by the internet and digital technologies. Videos, images, logs, and signals from IoT devices â€“ the diversity and quantity of data were unprecedented.

### Unstructured Data Management

The need to store and process unstructured data was one of the most significant drivers for this new technology to emerge. Traditional RDBMS systems were primarily designed for structured data.

### Volume of Data

Specifically, unstructured data is often generated in large volumes. Think about videos, images, logs, signals from IoT devices, etc. Another factor is the rise of the internet and digital technologies, which led to an explosion of data volumes.

### Machine Learning and AI Demands:

Data Analysts and Data scientists needed to experiment faster. With the traditional systems, only some of the organization's data is available. Sometimes, they might need to get access to the raw form of data to find the correlations and patterns.

### Speed of Data Access and Processing

With the old architecture, every time when they need a new data they have to go through the ETL process. This is time-consuming and not efficient. ML and AI require processing large datasets, often unstructured, for training and analysis. These fields need systems that can store all types of data and allow for rapid experimentation and analysis. Traditional ETL processes and data modeling were too slow for the dynamic needs.

### Cost and Scalability

With data volumes increasing, the cost of storage and processing became a critical factor. Technologies like Hadoop offered more scalable and cost-effective solutions for handling large datasets compared to traditional data warehouses. Especially with its **horizontally distributed** nature and allowing to use commodity hardware.

## Hadoop's Limitations

### Hard to work with structured data

Hadoop addressed these challenges by offering a framework that could handle both structured and unstructured data. It was a leap forward, particularly in managing unstructured data, which was often generated in massive volumes. However, Hadoop was not without its complexities. While it enabled the handling of large datasets, traditional Data Warehouses remained the go-to solution for structured data due to their efficiency and ease of use in dealing with such data types.

### Coupled storage and compute

One of the most significant downsides of Hadoop is that couples storage &compute. Why is this a problem?

Coupling storage and compute means that the same nodes are used for both storage and processing. There are two main issues with this:

- It's difficult to maintain and manage
- Un-flexible scaling. You have to scale both storage and compute together.

For example, having a PB of data doesn't mean you always need high-powered processing.

So, there was a need for a new architecture to simplify the management and scaling of data storage and processing.

## 2010's: Data Lakes

![History of Data Lakehouse - Data Lakes](/img/blog/from-data-warehouses-to-data-lakehouses/history-data-lakehouse-data-lakes.png)

Data Lakes represented this new architectural approach.

- By decoupling storage and compute, Data Lakes allowed for independent scaling of each, paving the way for more specialized tools for storage and processing.
- And, making it easy to work with structured data by introducing new file formats like Parquet, ORC, and Avro

### Decoupling storage and compute

![Data Lakes - Decoupled Storage and Compute](/img/blog/from-data-warehouses-to-data-lakehouses/data-lakes-decoupled-compute-storage.png)

Decoupling of storage and compute was a game changer. It allowed companies to scale their storage and compute independently. Also, it made the industry to create highly specialized tools for each of these responsibilities.

**On the storage side**, cloud object storages such as AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, and Google Cloud Storage became popular. These object storages are highly scalable, and specialized for storing large amounts of data in a cost-effective way.

And on the other hand, **compute side**, processing engines such as Apache Spark, Apache Presto, and others began to gain traction.

On the maintenance front, having decoupled responsibilities meant that object storage and computing sides could be managed separately.

### How to make it easy to work with structured data?

To recap and jog your memory from our discussion about Hadoop, Hadoop initially tackled semi-structured and unstructured data. However, structured data was also growing enormously, and companies were striving to centralize their architecture. Given the opportunity to store and process data on a single platform, it would naturally be more efficient than maintaining two distinct systems.

Remember, Data Lakes, as new iterations of Hadoop, excel at processing unstructured and semi-structured data. The challenge lies in making it easy to work with structured data types.

#### Columnar file formats - Faster structured data processing

Despite the advancements, a significant challenge remained: making it easier to work with structured data within Data Lakes. The traditional file formats like CSV, while simple, were not efficient for large-scale processing. This led to the development of more sophisticated file formats like Apache Parquet, which offered a column-based storage layout, more suited to analytical processing.

![Columnar file formats - Apache Parquet - Apache ORC](/img/blog/from-data-warehouses-to-data-lakehouses/columnar-file-formats.png)

Column-based storage layout is more efficient for analytical processing. It's because analytical systems are typically wide column tables, containing many columns. Generally, only a few specific columns are queried, so in a row-based layout, even when querying only a couple of columns, the entire data would have to be retrieved.

#### Improved metadata management

New tools and services were also developed to improve metadata management. Such as Hive Metastore. These tools allowed for the creation of tables on top of files in the data lake, making it easier to work with structured data.

##### ELT (Extract - Load - Transform) vs ETL (Extract - Transform - Load)

![ETL vs ELT](/img/blog/from-data-warehouses-to-data-lakehouses/etl-vs-elt.jpeg)

ELT was an interesting side effect of the Data Lake architecture.

Traditional data warehouses lacked the processing power, necessitating complementary tools specifically handling the transformation part.
The pattern was to extract and transform outside the data warehouse before loading it in.
This practice had its drawbacks, primarily that any issue in the transformation layer could result in data loss, as data from operational databases or other sources doesn't remain static.
In contrast, data lakes provide a cost-effective storage layer and open up a new way to extract, load into your data lake, and treat it as your historical source of truth.
Then, you handle the transformation later. Furthermore, these platforms aren't just competent storage options, they're also powerful processing engines.
Consequently, you can execute transformations directly inside your platform, effectively bypassing the need for an additional transformation layer outside your data warehouse.

## Data Lake Limitations

So, what were the issues with data lakes? What prompted the industry to invent a new architecture?

- Data lakes predominantly operated on an **insert and query** basis!
- Lacking features like **update, delete, merge** operations and **ACID transactions**.

Data lakes were efficient and have since received numerous enhancements including columnar files like the parquet file format. Additional services were also incorporated to store metadata and subsequently expose the files in the data lake as tables, a concept we're familiar with from data warehouses. However, these engines predominantly operated on an 'insert and query' basis, lacking features like 'update delete' operations and ACID transactions.

The absence of these capabilities led some companies to develop in-house solutions. Third-party tools attempted to address this problem as well, especially the transactional aspect. Implementing a transactional system in such platforms proves challenging, given that any changes to files necessitate updates, and these files were immutable. Suppose your process broke down halfway through your changes. How do you revert all modifications? This requires some form of versioning and is further complicated when consumers view the edited files, seeing only partial results.

The goal was to evolve toward a state similar to the one we're familiar with from data warehouse technologies. This includes transactional updates, insert deletes, superior schema management and governance, and improved security. Achieving this necessitated new developments on top of data lakes.

## 2020s: The Emergence of Data Lakehouses

![History of Data Lakehouse - Data Lakehouse](/img/blog/from-data-warehouses-to-data-lakehouses/history-data-lakehouse.png)

Data Lake limitations around transactional update/delete/merge operations, ACID transactions, and schema management led to a new architecture known as a **Data Lakehouse**.

A data lakehouse incorporates ACID transactions with update delete merge operations, improved data governance and schema management, and various other features like time travel versioning. Additionally, it provides enhanced metadata management. As the volumes of data are significant, its metadata storage also transitioned to object storage. These changes have brought data lake technology substantially closer to the level of data warehousing technology we're familiar with in terms of structured data processing.

Such technologies efficiently processed unstructured and semi-structured data, but the new data processing also made structured data processing more user-friendly. This is why we now see data lakehouses as a combined environment of data lakes and data warehousing.
