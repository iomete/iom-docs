## **Foundation: Control and Data Plane Architecture**

IOMETE implements a modern architecture built on two fundamental pillars: a centralized control plane for management and distributed data planes for processing. This architecture, built on Kubernetes, enables unprecedented deployment flexibility while maintaining consistent management and security controls.

The control plane serves as the central management layer, providing unified governance across the entire platform. This centralized approach enables enterprises to maintain consistent policies and controls while supporting diverse deployment scenarios. Organizations can manage multiple data planes across different regions or environments through a single control interface, significantly reducing operational complexity.

The data plane architecture enables flexible processing deployment while maintaining security and governance. Organizations can deploy processing resources across different Kubernetes clusters and namespaces, enabling efficient resource utilization while maintaining workload isolation. This flexibility proves particularly valuable for organizations operating across multiple regions or maintaining strict data sovereignty requirements.

## **Lakehouse Clusters (SQL Endpoints)**

IOMETE's lakehouse clusters represent a fundamental advancement in enterprise data processing. These SQL endpoints provide sophisticated query capabilities while maintaining security and governance requirements. The platform's deep integration with **business intelligence tools** enables organizations to leverage existing investments while implementing modern data capabilities.

**Multiple cluster** support enables organizations to optimize resource utilization for different workload types. For example, organizations can maintain dedicated clusters for interactive analytics while running batch reporting workloads on separate resources. This workload isolation ensures consistent performance while maximizing resource efficiency.

## **Interactive Data Analysis: SQL Editor**

IOMETE's built-in SQL Editor represents a sophisticated approach to interactive data analysis that combines enterprise-grade capabilities with intuitive usability. This integrated environment enables organizations to implement efficient data exploration and analysis workflows while maintaining security and governance controls.

The SQL Editor provides a complete workspace for data analysis through several key capabilities:

Worksheet Management enables teams to organize and maintain their analytical workflows efficiently. Users can create, save, and share queries while maintaining proper version control and documentation. This structured approach ensures analytical knowledge is preserved and can be leveraged across the organization.

Database Navigator functionality provides intuitive access to the entire data ecosystem. Users can explore available databases, tables, and views while maintaining proper access controls. This capability ensures efficient data discovery while enforcing organizational security policies.

## **Advanced Analytics: Jupyter and Spark Integration**

For organizations implementing advanced analytics and machine learning capabilities, IOMETE provides comprehensive support through integrated Jupyter notebooks and modern Spark architecture. The platform enables data science teams to leverage powerful processing resources while maintaining security and governance controls.

Spark Connect implementation represents a significant advancement in enterprise Spark deployment. The architecture enables stable operations through improved memory management while simplifying upgrades and maintenance. This approach reduces operational overhead while improving development efficiency through integrated debugging capabilities.

## **Enterprise Security Framework**

IOMETE's security architecture implements a sophisticated approach that decouples compute and data access controls. This design enables organizations to implement precise security policies while maintaining operational flexibility. The platform supports granular access controls, including row-level security and data masking, ensuring data protection while enabling appropriate access for different user roles.

## **Identity and Access Management Architecture**

The IOMETE platform implements a comprehensive Identity and Access Management (IAM) architecture that provides enterprise-grade authentication and authorization capabilities while ensuring seamless integration with existing infrastructure.

### **Authentication Framework**

The authentication system supports industry-standard protocols:

- LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) integration
- SAML 2.0 (Security Assertion Markup Language) federation
- OpenID Connect implementation
- SCIM 2.0 (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) protocol

### **Authorization System**

The platform employs a hierarchical access control model comprising:

- User entities with distinct security contexts
- Group-based access management
- Role-based permission framework

This architecture enables granular access control while maintaining operational efficiency through automated identity lifecycle management and standardized protocol support.
