    <p>
      Both IOMETE and Databricks provide data lakehouse capabilities. This comparison centers on
      deployment flexibility (including on-prem), control boundaries, open standards, and operational
      fit for modern architectures (including Data Mesh).

  <div className={styles.intro}>
    <p>
      Databricks can be a strong choice for teams that want a managed SaaS experience. IOMETE is built
      for organizations that need deployment flexibility (including on-prem), stronger sovereignty
      boundaries, and an open-standards-first lakehouse approach.
