<!-- truncate -->

## New single domain for IOMETE console

The console became easier to access through one single domain at. The old _\<account_number>.iomete.com_ domains have been removed. Use your 12-digit account number to sign in.

") -->

## Transparent pricing

We are proud to offer the most transparent pricing in the industry. Users pay the AWS on-demand compute price. No markups. You may select the AWS machine types supported by IOMETE from the interface and view the AWS price for that machine; IOMETE will charge you the same amount as AWS would charge you. Please keep in mind that prices vary depending on your AWS region.

## New Access Control System

Simply manage IOMETE permissions through the Access Control System. Detailed roles and permissions can be assigned to individuals and groups. Resource-based permissions are also supported. For a smooth transition, we enabled systems default permissions and allocated them to each user.

## Improved dashboard

The improved dashboard makes it easy to analyze your tasks and discover pain points. With the Grafana tool one can easily optimize spark jobs.

## Switch between accounts

Users can now easily switch between multiple IOMETE accounts. To switch between accounts, click on the profile button found on the left bottom side.

## Billing console

Users can quickly review and download invoices and arrange payment directly from IOMETE’s billing console.

## Role-based integrations

We removed “External Storage Integration”. Now we support only role-based and user-based integrations. Reason for this change was that the external type was not recommended by AWS and led to confusion.

## Lakehouse connection

To use lakehouse connection from Database Tools (for example, DataGrip) or Python (SQL Alchemy), you will have to update your connection details. For further details check the [datagrip lakehouse connection](/user-guide/datagrip-lakehouse-connection) and [SQL alchemy](/developer-guide/sql-alchemy-driver) driver documentation.

## Smaller updates and fixes

&#150; Superset BI now supports async query executions.

&#150; IOMETE’s built-in SQL Editor was optimized for a better experience.

&#150; UI improvements (Users, Groups, Storage Integrations now moved to Settings).

&#150; Many technical improvements to make your experience even better.
