Apache Iceberg brings warehouse-grade reliability to data lakes through immutable data files, versioned metadata, and snapshot isolation. Disaster recovery hinges on understanding how storage, metadata, and the catalog work together. This guide focuses on the Iceberg components that matter for recovery and the native procedures like register_table and snapshot rollbacks that restore service quickly.

## Understanding Iceberg's Architecture for Disaster Recovery

## The Critical Components

**Metadata Files:** The foundation of every Iceberg table lies in its metadata files (metadata.json), which contain table schema, partition specifications, and pointers to current snapshots. Each table operation creates a new metadata file with atomic updates, ensuring consistency but creating dependencies that must be preserved during recovery.

**Data Files:** The bulk of the storage consists of columnar data files in formats like Parquet or ORC. These files are immutable once written and are referenced through manifest files. While they represent the largest storage component, they're also the most straightforward to backup using standard file replication tools.

**Manifest Files:** Acting as an intermediate layer, manifest files maintain lists of data files along with partition information and column-level statistics. They enable Iceberg's query optimization capabilities and are essential for maintaining table performance after recovery.

**Catalog Entries:** The catalog maintains the connection between table names and their corresponding metadata files. Catalog corruption or misalignment can render tables inaccessible even when all files are present and intact.

## Snapshot Management and Time Travel Implications

Iceberg's snapshot-based architecture provides powerful recovery capabilities through its built-in time travel functionality. Each table modification creates a new snapshot, preserving the complete history of changes. This creates a natural checkpoint system that can be leveraged for point-in-time recovery scenarios.

However, snapshot management also introduces complexity for disaster recovery planning. Retaining too many snapshots increases storage costs and metadata complexity, while aggressive expiration policies may eliminate recovery options for historical point-in-time scenarios.

For disaster recovery purposes, organizations should maintain snapshots for at least their maximum acceptable data loss window, while considering storage implications and metadata performance.

## Common Iceberg Recovery Scenarios

### Human Error and Operational Mistakes

Human error remains one of the most common causes of data incidents in enterprise environments. Iceberg's time travel capabilities provide strong protection against many operational mistakes, but comprehensive disaster recovery planning must address scenarios where errors bypass normal safeguards.

**Accidental Data Deletion:** While Iceberg's architecture prevents truly destructive operations on historical data, DELETE operations can remove data from current snapshots. Recovery typically involves rolling back to a previous snapshot using the rollback_to_snapshot procedure.

**Schema Modifications:** Incorrect schema evolution operations can create compatibility issues with downstream applications. Iceberg's schema evolution capabilities allow for most corrections, but severe cases may require restoring to a previous table state.

**Configuration Errors:** Misconfigured table properties, especially those related to compaction and snapshot expiration, can lead to performance degradation or data availability issues. Recovery involves correcting configurations and potentially restoring optimal table layouts through maintenance operations.

### Data Corruption and Consistency Issues

While Iceberg's architecture provides strong consistency guarantees, corruption can still occur at the storage layer or through software bugs. Detecting and recovering from corruption requires understanding how Iceberg validates data integrity and what options exist when validation fails.

**File-Level Corruption:** Individual data file corruption can be detected through checksum validation during query execution. Recovery options include restoring affected files from backup or removing corrupted files and rebuilding from source data.

**Metadata Corruption:** Corruption of metadata files can be more serious, as it affects the entire table's accessibility. The atomic nature of metadata updates means corruption typically affects only the most recent metadata file, allowing recovery by rolling back to the previous valid state.

**Catalog Inconsistencies:** Misalignment between catalog entries and actual metadata file locations creates accessibility issues without true data loss. The register_table procedure provides a mechanism to re-establish these connections.

## Iceberg-Specific Recovery Procedures

### Using register_table for Catalog Recovery

The register_table procedure represents one of the most powerful tools in the Iceberg disaster recovery toolkit. This procedure allows you to re-establish the connection between a catalog and existing table metadata, effectively "registering" a table that exists in storage but lacks proper catalog entries.

**When to Use register_table:** This procedure is essential when catalog databases are lost or corrupted, when migrating tables between catalogs, or when restoring tables from backup where catalog entries weren't preserved. The procedure requires only the path to a valid metadata.json file and creates a new catalog entry pointing to that location.

**Implementation Example:**

```sql
CALL spark_catalog.system.register_table(
  table => 'sales_db.customer_orders',
  metadata_file => 's3a://backup-bucket/sales_db/customer_orders/metadata/v47.metadata.json'
);
```

**Best Practices:** Always verify the metadata file is the latest version for the table state you want to recover. Document metadata file locations as part of your backup procedures.

### Snapshot-Based Recovery Strategies

Iceberg's snapshot architecture provides granular recovery options that can address many disaster scenarios without requiring full table restoration. Understanding how to effectively use time travel and snapshot management is crucial for minimizing recovery time and data loss.

**Point-in-Time Recovery:** Use rollback_to_timestamp to recover to a specific point in time:

```sql
CALL catalog_name.system.rollback_to_timestamp(
  table => 'sales_db.customer_orders',
  timestamp => timestamp('2024-03-15 10:30:00')
);
```

**Snapshot-Specific Recovery:** When you know the exact snapshot ID to recover to:

```sql
CALL catalog_name.system.rollback_to_snapshot(
  table => 'sales_db.customer_orders',
  snapshot_id => 8744736658442914487
);
```

**Snapshot Analysis:** Before rolling back, analyze available snapshots to choose the optimal recovery point:

```sql
SELECT snapshot_id, committed_at, operation, summary
FROM sales_db.customer_orders.snapshots
ORDER BY committed_at DESC;
```

# Conclusion

Effective DR for Iceberg means treating metadata, snapshots, and the catalog as first-class backup assets. Combine routine backups with Iceberg-native procedures (register_table, rollback_to_snapshot, rollback_to_timestamp) and periodic recovery drills. Keep snapshot retention aligned to your maximum acceptable data loss and watch for configuration drift that can erode recovery options.
