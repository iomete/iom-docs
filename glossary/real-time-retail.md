# Real-Time Retail

## What is Real-Time Retail?

Real-time data provides accurate and timely insights that enable businesses to make informed decisions and improve supply chain agility, reduce costs, optimize product availability, and replenish stock.

With the shift to e-commerce and omni-channel commerce, consumer behaviors have fundamentally changed, and businesses must adapt to remain competitive. The recent volatility in supply chains has compounded these changes, making real-time access to data more important than ever.

With IOMETE's real-time data differentiated capabilities, retailers can make data available for real-time decisions, avoid costly mistakes, and engage customers based on current data.
